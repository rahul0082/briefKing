# Report

## Beginning of the project
* Studies Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* Revised ML concepts and completed the [Machine learning crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course "Machine learning") by google

## Checkpoint 1
### Speech Recognition
Explored different Speech to text Libraries in Python
* Implemented different speech to text models like google speech, Bing speech, Wit.AI, IBM speech using [Speech Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) Python Package
* We found some of these doing well and have advanced features but they required paid subscription, so we backed off.
* Implemented the Indian English model of [Vosk API](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) and tested it for different types of audio files.
### Denoising
* Tried basic denoising models using gaussian denoising.
* Implemented [Facebook Denoiser](https://github.com/facebookresearch/denoiser) and applied it to different types of audio files.

## Checkpoint 2
* Studies NLP from basics and implemented tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, tfidf using NLTK
* Explored various datasets for abstractive text summarization
